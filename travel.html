                <!--<p>Christina, write this paragraph.  We considered writing a detailed timeline of our relationship, but quickly realized that there is nothing extraordinary about the facts of our story.  We met at college in 2009 and have been having fun together ever since. Suffice it to say that we both feel extremely lucky to have found someone that we truly adore. The last seven years have been an incredible adventure and we  are excited to see what the future holds. We can’t wait to celebrate our devotion to one another with our family and friends, and 88,000 NASCAR fans.</p>-->
                <p>The Dell Lea is located at 81 Pleasant Street in Chichester, NH.  The largest NASCAR race is held on Sunday but there are also qualifying races Saturday afternoon.  We have been assured traffic is not too heavy on Saturday but  Route 106 should be avoided as this is where the racetrack is located.  Route 93 and 393 may also be backed up at this time.</p>
                <p>We would like to invite everyone to arrive at the venue early to be able to enjoy the ceremony on time.  Drinks and light snacks will be provided and you may arrive up to an hour early.</p>
                <p>Helpful Apps: If you don’t already use Waze it is a great app that will help with avoiding traffic.  It will reroute you the best way possible based on updates from other users who are stuck in traffic at that moment.</p>
