                        <h3>Sarah McClur & Allison Chishold</h3>
                        <p>Christina met Sarah and Ally their freshman year in college at Framingham State that fateful year they were all assigned to live in the same dorm.  It has been 10 years filled with incredible adventures, laughter, shenanigans, and an unreasonable amount of fondue. To say they are the very best friends a girl could ask for is just not enough.  Their support and guidance through everything in life is unwavering and planning a wedding is no exception.  It was hard for Christina to write this without being intolerably sappy but truly if everyone in life had friends like Sarah and Allison the world would be a happier place.</p>

                        <p>Alex is Andrew’s older brother and his best man. He provided Andrew with a pretty great example to follow when they were growing up, and helped get Andrew out of trouble when he didn’t follow that example. Alex is the kind of brother that would drive four hours to be left alone in the woods for an additional two hours before dawn if that’s what was asked of him.</p>

                        <p>Kara and Christina are close because they grew up together as cousins and friends.  Always older and cooler, Kara was there for Christina first as a playmate and then as a forever friend, supporter and confidant to the bride-to-be.  Before each goodbye you may catch the elusive but decades old “secret handshake” that the two created all those years ago. </p>

They were teammates on their high school wrestling team, co-workers, hunting and fishing buddies, and travel companions. Andrew considers himself very lucky to have spent so much time with someone as unselfish and dependable as Dave.</p>

                        <p>Andrew and Rick met during their freshman year in college. They became friends right away and have since lived together in four different houses. Rick’s positivity, energy and inexhaustible capacity for problem solving are just a few of the things that make him a pleasure to be around. Just don’t leave him alone in a room with a cat, as it will probably end up in a drawer.</p>

                        <p>Friends through the miracle of science!  In reality Corinne and Christina have lived parallel lives as the significant others to Dartmouth graduate students.  Through Andrew’s lab mate and groomsman Scott, Christina and Corinne met and became close friends.  The pair can often be found tagging along to various events, having movie nights at home, dragging the boys on double dates or watching football together.</p>

                        <p>Another friend credited to science!  Really some seriously important stars aligned along the way to give Christina such great friends in the Upper Valley.  Through Adam, another groomsman, Kara and Christina quickly became fast friends.  We are excited to move closer to one another again because the best kind of friends are friends that understand a love for all things cheese, game nights, pajamas, and long awaited visits that feel like no time has passed at all.</p>

                        <p>Adam and Andrew were merely acquaintances when they were both asked to run for Graduate Student Council. In the ensuing race reputations were tarnished, and bridges were burned. In fact, Andrew posted a doctored image of George Bush eating an ear of corn, except George Bush’s face was replaced with Adam’s and the corn was replaced with a kitten. Somehow all was forgiven, and now they’re thick as thieves!</p>

                        <p>Christina’s brother Mark and Andrew were first introduced when Mark was just 17. Since their introduction, Andrew has enjoyed spending time with Mark. He is so technically skilled in computer science and electronics that most visits to the Cheli household involve a tutorial on his new custom built electronic device. He’s such a good guy that he’s willing to let Andrew continue to use these devices, even with his propensity for damaging them. He also created this whole website and we couldn't be more thankful for his help!</p>

In addition to their time in lab, they’ve been able to engage in some friendly competition in the form of fantasy football. Both at work and outside of work Scott is the same great guy. You’d think that since he’s such a good person karmic balance in the universe would have delivered him a fantasy football championship. Alas no.</p>
